# Python Test Driven Development Project

## Project Overview

This project is focused on implementing a simple function that adds two integers, following the principles of Test Driven Development (TDD). The project includes the implementation of the `add_integer` function, which handles various input types and raises appropriate exceptions for invalid inputs. Additionally, the project contains a suite of tests to ensure the function behaves as expected.
