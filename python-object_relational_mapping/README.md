# Python - Object-Relational Mapping

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of Python with MySQL databases using two different approaches: direct SQL queries with the `MySQLdb` module and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) with the `SQLAlchemy` library. The goal is to perform various database operations such as retrieving, filtering, inserting, updating, and deleting records in a MySQL database.
